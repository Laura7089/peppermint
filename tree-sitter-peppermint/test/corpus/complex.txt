Sample ten plus 5

# here's a very simple program that calculates 10+5 and stores it at 0x21:
10
STORE [0x20]
5
ADD [0x20]
STORE [0x21]

Sample Loop

# here's a simple program using labels and JUMPS:
1
STORE [0x110]
0
STORE [0x100]
loop: ADD [0x110]
JUMP :loop

	(label)
	(statement (instruction
		(opcode) (operand (address))))
