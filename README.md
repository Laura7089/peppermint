# ðŸŒ¿ Peppermint

A tasty assembly language and tool suite for the [Tick Talk Processor](https://github.com/monsonite/TICK_TALK).
Take a look at [`sample_program.ppr`](./sample_program.ppr) for a walkthrough.

This repo contains:

- A CLI multitool in `cli`; `cargo run` will run it by default
- A rust library for parsing Peppermint in `peppermint-rs`
- A rust library for simulating Peppermint in `simulate`
- A [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar for Peppermint to assist with editing
